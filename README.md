# AGILATOR

Agilator is an Agile Capacity Calculator. 
Its purpose is to make it easier to plan and calculate the time of all team members when starting a sprint.

The team members could work at different working hours in the different projects. Sprints could also be of different durations.

Calculated data can be visualized in hours, days or percentages.
